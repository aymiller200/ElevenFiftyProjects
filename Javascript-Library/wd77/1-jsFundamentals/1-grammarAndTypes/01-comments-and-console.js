//console.log
//outputs some message to the console
console.log('this is a console.log message!'); 
//log is what is called a method. Something we can run from within the console.

console.log('separate parts of a console message with commas,', 'just like this!');
//the comma b/t the orange strings is making that space in the console.log. It's basically a separation. 

console.log(13, 15, 17, 18);

//console.log and debugging
//we can debug with console.log messages in 2 big ways:
//1) we can check the statues of some js 'thing'. It's like a magnifying glass.
//2) we can check a process we have built with repeated console.log messages.

//example
//var= variable. Basically a bucket that holds things
var sampleName = "Ayanna";
console.log(sampleName);

//example 2
var sampleNum = 1; 
console.log(sampleNum);
sampleNum++; //++ adds 1 to variable
console.log(sampleNum);
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum);
